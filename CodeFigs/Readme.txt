This is the code associated with the paper "Ecological diversification in sexual and asexual lineages." The main folder contains two folders:

1) AdaptiveDynamicsModel: This folder contains the MATLAB codes for figures 2 and 3. To produce figures 2 and 3, it is necessary to run "MakeFigures2and3.m".


2) IBM: This folder contains two folders: Asexual_lineage and Sexual_lineage. Each of them contains the MATLAB routines and functions necessary to simulate a lineage with the alternative reproductive modes based on the IBM presented in the methods. To simulate the lineages, running the routine "RepSimAsexual.m" or "RepSimSexual.m" is necessary.
